## Background
Pingu is one of the most lovable characters in animation. He loves many things such as playing around, eating fish and messing with his little brother. Something he does not like are any forms of hate speech, violent remarks, and spreading of misinformation. Pingu will help us monitor Discord servers for such hate speech and harmful content to the best of his ability. The Pingu Discord bot utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 to interpret Discord messages and filters inappropriate or harmful comments accordingly. **NOTE: We are NOT affiliated with the Pingu animated series and any references to Pingu are meant to add comedic effect to the bot. Messages that the bot sends are NOT affiliated with the owners of the franchise.** hehe

## Motive
We want to create a discord bot for chat moderation, insuring that hateful comments and remarks are flagged and censored (with optional uncensoring). This will hopefully help make any discord server a safer and friendly place.

## Scope
The scope of the discord bot will primarily focus on text messages only. This means that any NSFW, violent or other related images will not be flagged by the bot.
